# Lab3
This is my third lab assignment for CISC 3130. This Repository contains the following: CSV File of Spotify's Regional Global Daily Top 200 List, Main Lab3.java program that reports which artists and how many of their songs are listed, OutputText file Artist-WeekOf08302020.txt which is the output file of the report.

This java program prints out all the names of the artists in the regional global daily top 200 week of 08/30/2020. Using the previous code in my second lab assignment, I added a sorting method into the code in this assignment in order to sort the names of the artists.
